# üìù Todo App with Dual CRUD Approaches

This project demonstrates two ways to manage a Todo application:

1. **Traditional REST API** (Manual CRUD)
2. **Dynamic Automation Engine** (Powered by YAML or JSON)

Each step showcases how we can achieve basic functionality using the traditional method first, and then how to
accomplish the same goal ‚Äî often more flexibly ‚Äî using the automation engine.

# Step 1: Manual CRUD API (Baseline)

This is the traditional way of managing todos using Spring Boot's `@RestController` and service classes. All endpoints
follow standard REST conventions.

### ‚úÖ Manual API Endpoints

Base URL: `/api/todos/manual`

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                   |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| POST   | `/`              | Create a new todo             |
| GET    | `/`              | Get all todos                 |
| GET    | `/{id}`          | Get a todo by ID              |
| PUT    | `/{id}/title`    | Update a todo's title         |
| PUT    | `/{id}/status`   | Change the todo's status      |
| PUT    | `/{id}/assign`   | Assign the todo to a user     |
| PUT    | `/{id}/unassign` | Unassign the todo from a user |
| DELETE | `/{id}`          | Delete the todo               |

### üß© Example Usage

#### Create a Todo

```http
POST /api/todos/manual
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

title=Buy groceries&statusCode=OPEN
```

#### Update Title

```http
PUT /api/todos/manual/1/title
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

title=Buy milk
```

## üí° What Happens When Requirements Change?

Imagine the business adds a new requirement:

> üì® "Send an email notification after a todo is created and assigned to someone."

### ‚ùì How do we handle this with the traditional approach?

There are a couple of common ways to do this in Spring Boot:

---

### üõ† Option 1: Add Logic Directly in `TodoService`

One way is to inject an EmailService into TodoService and call it right after assignment:

```java
if (todo.getAssigneeUsername() != null) {
    emailService.sendAssignmentEmail(todo.getAssigneeUsername(), todo.getTitle());
}
```
‚úÖ Pros:
- Simple and direct
- Easy to implement in small projects

‚ùå Cons:
- Business logic gets tightly coupled to service logic
- Difficult to maintain as features grow
- Failures in email sending could block todo creation

### üßµ Option 2: Publish an Event
A better approach is to decouple the email logic using an event-driven architecture:
```java
applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(new TodoAssignedEvent(todo));
```
Then, create an event listener to handle the email sending:

```java
@EventListener
public void handle(TodoAssignedEvent event) {
    emailService.sendAssignmentEmail(event.getAssigneeUsername(), event.getTitle());
}
```

‚úÖ Pros:
- Keeps TodoService focused on core logic
- Easier to test and evolve 
- Supports async and retry logic

‚ùå Cons:
- Requires more infrastructure (Spring events, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- Harder to trace the full execution flow
